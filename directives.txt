Comprehensive book on motion planning:

	It is written by one of the people that proposed the RRT algorithm, Prof. Steve LaValle from UIUC
	(academic advisor of Prof. Jingjin Yu, an assistant professor in the department)
	Chapter 4 describes the concept of the Configuration Space
	Chapter 5 introduces sampling-based motion planning algorithms

The following paper describes the conditions under which different sampling-based algorithms converge to optimal paths:
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1186
	It is quite long with a lot of proofs
	But you can find here the exact description of the connectivity radius or the number of radius needed for PRM*.
	e.g., on page 14 it specifies that k(n) := k_{PRM} log(n), where k_{PRM} > e(1 + 1/d)
	d is the dimensionality of the problem, so in our case 2

Finally, the recent paper that is actually moving the nodes of an RRT is the following one:

	And the code for it is available here:

Considering strategies for moving nodes of the PRM or the RRT
